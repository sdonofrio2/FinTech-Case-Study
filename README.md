### Landscape

### Recommendations
* If I were to advise the company, I would suggest offering similar streaming directly to the consumer. 
* Allowing various video streams directly to customers would create more brand awareness and potentially influence more network participants, which would grow Livepeer's network.
* This additional service could still use the same network built on the Etherium blockchain.
